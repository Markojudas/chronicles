Yesterday I attend the info session via Zoom for the CodePath Technical Interview Prep course I have applied to. On my last post I went over one of the 9 questions I had to answer for the calibration assessment. I believe I did well, especially on the multiple choice questions as they were very basic. The 3 coding questions were also quite simple; besides the one I went over on my last post I also had a question dealing with the pre-order traversal of a tree to sum up all the left leaves. The last question I did not completely solve - not all tests passed. For this question I had to compare two lists <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> each storing the amount of goals per game scored by the two teams respectively. I had to return a new list with the amount of games team B score less or the same as Team A. The reason not all tests passed was because I exceeded the time limit. I guess my algorithm wasn't optimal. But that's the reason I am taking this course! I want to be better at solving these problems!

I have also decided to actually concentrate on Python for coding assessments. Python's syntax is closer to English than other languages and easier to write though not necessarily the fasted (being an interpreted language and missing that awesome JIT of Java). Maybe I should stick with Java? I have not coded with Java in a long time (I had to refresh my memory on how to handle ArrayLists!). I wish I could just score a job so I can stick with whatever language they use (lol).

The job hunting still goes on. I have applied to Motorola for 3 different positions/locations. I have applied for two Entry Level DevOps positions and one entry-level position. 2 of those applications were submitted over a month ago and I'm yet to hear back from them. Along with those, I have submitted my application to other places. As I was applying for the last job opening I saw, I noticed I was a "bit" rushed filling out the application. I should do all of this when I'm comfortable and time to write a nice 1-page cover letter.

Another thing that I have been thinking is the actual job that I'd like, I think that's DevOps. The idea of creating and maintaining tools for whatever goal sounds pretty cool. If I could make my job easier with automating a daily task and save time sounds pretty damn cool. Examples of me doing so already are the BASH scripts I've written (Bookmark Tool & C# .NET helper for Linux). Both very simple tools and even more simple scripts but I am very proud of both.

Well... 'till next time
