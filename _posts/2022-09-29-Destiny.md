<p>Fate's completely in my hands...</p>

It is incredibly how hard work, persistance, and grit pays off. A little change on my resume seems to have made a big impact, though it almost backfired, also attending that career fair was a game changer. For the next couple days/weeks I have my schedule pretty hectic with interviews for potential employment as a software engineer in different places. I am most excited about Progressive. Funny enough what got me in was my 10+ years of experience in the Auto Insurance industry (as a claims adjuster), which I had JUST taken off of my resume!. Luckily, an ex-classmate of mine, whom I helped during our Windows Programming class was one of the recruiters/swe in the interview! - that helped. Now I will be receiving an invitation for a final round of interviews in CLEVELAND OHIO for next week (10/6 10/7). I also have scheduled an interview with Dell for their SWE/IT rotational program tomorrow (09/30). Another interview is scheduled for Monday (10/3) with Kaseya and another scheduled for Monday (10/10) with Statefarm for a SWE/Cloud Engineer(AWS) position. This are DEFINITELY shaping up! Even if I don't land any of these positions I consider this all a win. Getting this far is a win on itself. 

Maybe my next post will be once I get my feet into the tech world!
