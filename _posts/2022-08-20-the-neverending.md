I have been admitted to CodePath's Technical Interview Prep course this summer. Meanwhile I keep tweaking my resume, practicing leetcode/hackerrank problems, and practicing Python as my chosen language for the interviews. As of today, I have decided to concentrate mostly on sharping on my Data Structures and Algorithms. Yesterday I tried a problem (leveled as easy) in which I needed the assistance of the <strong>set</strong> Data Structures. Now, from previous courses (such as Data Structures, Discrete Structures, and other math and logic courses) I understand what a <em>Set</em> is - collection of unique elements, basically. However, I'm not 100% comfortable implementing same from scratch, let alone properly use it to solve problems. Another revelation, if you will, is algorithms, I need to sharpen my BFS (breadth first search) and DFS (depth first search) for tree/graph traversal. Therefore, I will concentrate on finishing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second-dp-1680507222/dp/1680507222/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms: Level Up your Core Programming Skills</a> book. I also want to get more comfortable with <strong>Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)</strong>; I am currently also studying to apply those concepts with Docker and Jenkins as they seem to be a constant in all qualification requirements on job listings - I also think DevOps is the space I'll shine the brightest.
