<p>I finished my self-imposed project. The last step was to create a Windows Desktop Application to easily update the S3 Bucket and MongoDB Atlas. I also decided to deploy the site as 1 application (instead of 2, backend and frontend, separately as the tutorial suggested) using Heroku. I went a step further and got a new domain for it and got some SSL certificate from Heroku - I think it is $7/month. <a href="https://markojudas-music.com" target="_blank">Markojudas' Music</a>.</p>

<p>This project proved itself to be a nice learning-by-doing project. I learned more about Javascript/Typescript, NodeJS, Angular, MongoDB, AWS SDK (S3), and WFA C# .NET framework. I'm pretty happy and proud of this (pretty personal and useless project :)).</p>

<p>I am starting this new job on 1/23/2023 (3 effing weeks!) and I'm extremely excited and nervous about this</p>
<br>
<p>'till next time,</p>
<p>Jose</p>
