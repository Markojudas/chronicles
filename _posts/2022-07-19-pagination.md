I have added pagination to this here blog! It was a bit confusing especially using github pages due to the destination path. I need to pay attention to the `relative url` as that seem to have done the trick. Once that was done it was pretty simple. Jekyll is such a powerful took for site creation!

Yours,

Jose :)
