Just another rainy day in South Florida. Supposedly hurricane season started but it seem it has been raining at least half a week since the beginning of the year. Today I continued my studies of Web Development with the Go programming language. This is serving to solidify what I learned during my previous course of the fundamentals of the language; I think I need more (and proper) understanding of web development (html & css). The making of this here blog/journal/chronicles, call it whatever you wish, proved that I can only pretend to know so much :)

Once I've finished this course of WebDev with Go, I will learn more about Docker/Containers and Kubernetes... I really should be doing some leetcode and get better at problem solving programmatically.

Yours truly,

Jose
