title: One Month In!

I have been working at a Fortune 100 company for over a month as a software developer/ IT apps programmer associate. So far the company has put so much faith and resources into my development but I am yet to contribute. However, I am NOT expected to do so early! My expectation is to show a willingness to learn which I think I have shown this and more.  I am spending my weekend learning more about NGRX since is a key technology for the team. While working I am joining my mentor and other developers in pair programming and getting a taste how things are done. Other times I am running the application locally to gain a technical understanding of the application and formulate questions for my mentor or others.

The application the team is working is massive to say the least. The main purpose of the application is to streamline the process of referring the customer to a body-shop. The users are claims reps (either the file owner, a CSR, or a field rep). The application is accessed directly or, more commonly, when a customer calls to report the accident "FNOL". When the application is triggered from FNOL it starts in a "landing page" where the rep will identify the *caller* and the *vehicle*. Then the application will route to the *interview* components. These components depend on the input the rep provides. It will eventually make an call to a 3rd party API to obtain information about a body shop; this is either the ***repair*** or ***Drive-in*** workflow. The Drive-In workflow is for when the vehicle is drivable but denies PEG (Photo Estimate Group) and requires a "drive in" for an estimate. It will also work for a non-repairable but drivable vehicle... again "needing estimate". These workflows work with other applications (Scripting Engine and Data), depending on some API calls the engine will select what data (script) to show to the application.

Quite complex...

I will master this!
