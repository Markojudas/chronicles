title: Go: leetcode & AWS

A lot (and not so much) has happened since my last post. I have been struggling with the so-called imposter syndrome. Since my interviews with UKG I have been auto rejected from most of the companies I have applied to while from the Others I have not received any response whatsover (which at this point they feel as an answer on tiself). However, I remain focused and excited. I have been told that this is a game of numbers and a test of my will. 

Despite of all it, I continue my journey learning Web Dev with Go while testing my Go knowledge by applying waht I am learning with LeetCode problems. The problems I have been working on the last 10 days have been problems I have solved before with Java (which is the language that I am more comfortabel with though I have NOT practiced in a bit) so I am just transcribing the code into Go. This process is forcing me to go through the Go documentation and language specification (which IS a different skill on itself). I am also practicing the formatting of **markdown** files with **HTML** code. Soon I will run into new problems and that will be quite interesting to solve it from scratch using Go.

I have also been able to put my Amazon Web Services (AWS) skills to the test with Go!. I have created Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instances, set up with security groups accepting connections via SSH. The security group also accepts connections via MYSQL/AURORA (port 3306) and also from a load balancer. I set up a mysql database, so I have also learned how to interact with a mysql database with Go (including importing the driver to be able to use the database/mysql package). I created a Relational Database using AWS RDS and I set up an auto scalling policies that will keep my application highly available (HA) through different Availability Zones (AZ). The only I can access the web application through port 80 (HTTP), using the DNS-NAME of the load balancer, which directs traffic to different EC2 instances demostrating the HA. 

I am continuing my job search. I will keep my head held high. I will succeed!

Yours,

Jose aka Markojudas
