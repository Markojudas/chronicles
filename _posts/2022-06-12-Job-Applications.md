I have applied and sent my resume to several places the last couple of days but the 2 places I am most excited about are <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://ukg.com">Ultimate Kronos Group (UKG)</a> both for a software engineer position. These two companies are leaders in the industry. I have heard amazing things of UKG's culture and every one knows GitHub as the leader of Open Source and collaborations!. Right now, though I know I am writing into the Void, I need all the good ju-ju I can get.

Meanwhile, I continue my Web Development with Go. I have learned about the net and http packages. Go appears to make things so much easier! Definitely the interface (OOP concept) is so MUCH easier to understand and <em>implement</em> than Java or C#. This concept is VERY important to grasp to understand the http package. The net package it's a little easier(?), at least so far.

Anywho, it is time for me to hit the hay.

Your's truly,
