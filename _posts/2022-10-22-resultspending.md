<p>The trip to Cleveland Ohio was a success! Progressive seems to be an amazing company to work; I was totally sold by the different people I got to speak with. Those two dates were insane though; hardly any time to chill!. The interviews were very interesting to say the least. I can tell they care a lot about culture and making sure we are right fit for the job. The first interview was pretty straightforward but I was able to answer all the questions the best I could. The second interview, however, was very strange in the best sense of the word; it was a conversation between two people. I was able to truly tell my story and show how I handle myself and how I do not shy away from challenges. I got the offer and I have accepted it - pending the background check. I know my background check will pass but I'm still very worried and stressed out about it.</p>

<p>Now I'm just trying to recover from COVID</p>
