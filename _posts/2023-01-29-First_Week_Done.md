<p>I finished the first week as an IT Apps Programmer Associate for Progressive. This was mostly an orientation, where we were introduced to the different systems, programs, and resources available to us as Progressive Employees. I gotta say, it is quite a lot. It truly seems Progressive is an amazing company to work for. I'll be able to further my career with their help. I'm so excited!!!!!!</p>
<p>This coming week I will be meeting my team Hydra (HAIL HYDRA) and I'll even join my first scrum meetings, though I won't be contributing just yet. I am so stoked to begin to pull cards and complete them and kick ass!!!! AHHHHHHHH</p>

<p>Till then, </p>
<p>Jose</p>
