I am so glad I decided to stick to the plan this time. Well, kind of. I am concentrated mostly on sharpening up my Data Structures and Algorithms. This is proven to be quite the right move as I'm getting more understanding about Big Oh and recursions and to be able to recognize with DS to use. 

Now, I am also tweaking my <a href="http://https://github.com/Markojudas/">github</a> just to show practical projects and fixing all of the READMEs. I am now starting to use my Windows 11 machine(s) after SEVERAL months of just using Linux (Fedora 36). I think I have kinda become more efficient even on Windows than what I was before!. Still, I think I now prefer Linux. The reason for this switch (back) is because I want to work on my Windows Forms Applications with C# (.NET Framework) and I THE tool to use is Visual Studios (2022), which is only available on Windows. But the "side effects" have been learning some PowerShell scripting (I created the "touch" alias mapping to "NewItem -Path . -Value 'file'") and other cool things!.

One of the applications I am working on is <a href="https://github.com/Markojudas/">NeatOffice</a>. A feature of this application is that accepts a text (.txt) or a comma-separated-value (.csv) file(s), both containing the vertex of a undirected and connected graph, and prints the result of finding the "minimum spanning tree" and the shortest paths. I did not have the original sample input (provided by the instructor who assigned this project during class last year). Thankfully, I have class mate who did... but only the .txt file. This file has 100 lines and each line has about 400 characters. I was NOT going to manually convert it to .csv. Before I continue, I am aware I could have googled a free converter or maybe there is a better way even. I needed to get this .csv file.

I remember that early last year I had written a File Conversion programmed in C. This program would convert a .csv file to some made-up file format back-and-forth. So I successfully modified (and cleaned up) the program to just convert from .txt to .csv and back. Now I have ANOTHER project to add to my github!

I consider this a small nerd victory!

Yours,
Jose Hernandez
