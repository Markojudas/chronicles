The grind never stops. Today I completed the LeetCode Programming Skill I study path - I did 12 days in 10 days. Not sure how that worked.
I have also just applied to enroll in <a href="https://apply.codepath.com/cohorts/interview-prep-fall-2022/versions/student/?ref=8aaxxtB0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codepath's Techincal Interview Prep Course (Fall 2022)</a> to further prepare for techinical interviews. I will rest for the rest of week and starting this weekend I will start LeetCode 75 Study Plan which also prepares me for techinical interviews.

My Go Web Development is a slow progress since I am taking notes from the documentation but I'm about less than 6 hours left. Once I am done, as practice, I will likely make a project to keep a database for my music/video collections - not too sure though.

Anywho,

**btw**: I changed the font! :)
