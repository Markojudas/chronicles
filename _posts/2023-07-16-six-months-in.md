title: Six Months In

It's been almost 6 months since I started this new career. I am still in awe how happy I am with everything. Learning something new every day AND get paid for this!?
It does not get any better than this. I have accomplished so much and provided some value to the team. The other day I helped a fellow associate from my same cohort with her build
and I received a **TAP (Thank and Peer)** and that's pretty cool! This past week I was able to decipher some `.yml` files the pipeline to deploy to a lab environment. I have never dealt with this
I was able to debug and fixed it! Now the team is able to develop a lot easier without having to manually go to AWS and change the DynamoDB records and prevent any data "lost in translation". Friday I attempted to update our application from Node 16/Angular 14 to Node 18/Angular 16 but I am currently getting some issues with the `esbuild` installed. I have not seen other applications in the enterprise that has this package `esbuild/win32-x64` in their `package.json` file so I am at a loss here. The good thing about it is I was working ahead... so I have already updated bunch of the packages and just need to fix this issue so I can move on to sync up the _Angular_ changes and the code base. Learning by DOING!

I'll keep y'all (myself) posted,

Jose
