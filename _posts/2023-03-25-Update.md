Acid King has gone and released which I think is their greatest record yet. They have embraced this psychedelic sound and left that grungy/desert-y sound leaving us with walls of sounds.
I can't wait to properly enjoy this record soon.

This past week was month 2 at my current job as a software developer. I think I am getting the hang of it and I'll soon be playing with the big dogs! I have learned quite a lot about NGRX and RXJS while
getting myself familiar with the code base. I need to take a breather and not put too much pressure on myself lest I burn out. Just trust the process. 

The last 2 weeks have been chaotic to say the least. I booked an appointment to get the floor of our room fixed but just a week prior we had problems with the electricity. Now we have a brand new main circuit
panel (looks beautiful!) and new floors. The purging of clothes and unnecessary stuff is in full swing!

I am happy but I can't be complacent. I gotta keep earning my keep and let this company and my co-workers know that I am a valuable member.

'till I have more to share,

Jose
