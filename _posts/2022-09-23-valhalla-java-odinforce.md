The last few weeks have been quite interesting to say the least. I have been doing the Grokking the Coding Interview, done some neatcode.io, and reading a Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures which I'm basically on the last chapter. The Codepath's course for technical interview prep is in full swing as of last week and it's going pretty neat so far. I have also redone my Resume countless of times. The weekend for last I participated in a hack-a-thon (though I didn't hack nor worked on any projects) where I tried to network with some recruiters and engineers from different companies. Earlier this week I participated in a in-person career fair at FIU. That was quite an experience. I managed to talk to several companies and spread my resume around. I was called back for an actual interview with Progressive for a Software Engineer position the very next day. Yesterday I received an email from Dell for a position in their rotation program which I formally applied for as requested and now i have to pick a time slot for an actual interview. 

Things are looking quite bright! But this hustle won't ever end!

yours,
Jose
