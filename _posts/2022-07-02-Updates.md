I have updated my personal site to include an actual about me page. This has taught me a little bit more about CSS and different HTML attributes. I got to play around with the `table` html tag. Having a TODO list within my line-of-sight is proving to be quite helpful to keep me focused and, accountable. It is all about personal accountability! My next thing to tackle is an actual `skills, certificates, & projects` page to showcase my, well, skills. This 4th of July weekend I will be also tweaking my resume and shift to overdrive my job hunting. I will not rest until my goals are materialized.

Yours in power,

Jose aka Markojudas
