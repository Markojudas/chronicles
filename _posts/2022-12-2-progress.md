<p>A lot has happened during the month of November. The biggest thing that happened was being laid off from my job of Examiner.
My 10+ years of working in the insurance space as a claims adjuster ended with me being laid off, ain't that something?
Luckily I had already excepted the offer from Progressive (HA!! so much from being over with Insurance) and my starting date is 1/23/2023.
This means I was saved from writing my 2 weeks notice and always I have been granted some time to spend with my family and "chill".</p>
<br>
<p>However, I've been just as enthused and ready to start this new journey. I have been going through some courses to properly learn HTML & CSS.
Please do not take this blog site as an indication of such progress because this was done BEFORE taking said course. I did redid the main <a href="https://markojudas.com">page</a>
to make a little better. I might (eventually) re-do this blog and the subpages but definitely not now.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>With that said, see ya'll later</p>
Jose
