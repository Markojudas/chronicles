I refuse to stop the grind, though I need to refocus my efforts lest I waste my time and energy. It seems that it is quite easy to fall into the endless pit of learning new technologies; the excitement of learning new things is quite addicting. I love learning and I am not scared of jumping into unknown waters (though I do not know how to swim, literally). However, everything has a time and place and, currently, I need to focus in landing a job. I have applied to several jobs pending a response and I have been in talks with several peers (former class-mates) that have landed and/or are on the same grind. We share different resources and tips - I love my village!.

Last post I mentioned that I had applied to enroll in a 10 week course with CodePath - Technical Interview Prep Course. Well, I have confirmed my spot for the intermediate track which will start in September. I will be spending 4 hours weekly with an instructor and several other people in my same or similar spot. This shall be quite interesting and exciting. I am also doing some interview problems with <a href="https://neetcode.io">NeetCode.io</a> which gives me leetcode problems. I am currently doing these with Python as I believe that is the best language for code assessments and technical interviews. I am also going over the Grokking the Technical Interview: Coding Interview Patterns from <a href="https://educative.io">educative.io</a> and reading some articles about the technical interview. All of this will pay off at the end! I know it!

Early this week I attended a talk (zoom) with Lockheed Martin where several key players spoke about their mission within their respective areas. Sadly, there aren't any positions that work for (I need something in the "Greater Miami/Ft. Lauderdale Area" or 100% remote if further away) as I am not able to relocate. Today I am attending an event hosted by UPE (one of the biggest tech student organizations) to help me with the job hunt. This weekend I will be retouching my resume...

I need to keep this energy and not let the lack of responses bring me down - I've got to remain laser focused and strong.

Yours,

Jose
