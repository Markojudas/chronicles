<p>Yesterday was my first day as an Associate Software Developer at Progressive. The day consisted was basically orientation as the rest of the week will be, or so it seems. I'm extremely excited and nervous but very optimistic. It is pretty intense knowing that I did a full on career change after 10 years of adjusting claims but this is what I signed up for!</p>
<p>UPWARDS AND ONWARD!</p>
<br>
Jose!
