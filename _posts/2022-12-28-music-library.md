I have finished this web application I tasked myself with over a month ago. The idea came when I took a course and dealt with MongoDB.
This application uses the stack: Angular, NodeJS, MongoDB Atlas, and AWS S3 and Elastic Beanstalk. To complete this project I learned some Javascript, Typescript, Nodejs, and Angular.
<br><br>
The next step will be creating a "companion" application (desktop application) to easily add/update bands to both the S3 bucket (for image hosting) and to the database. This application will be written using C# .NET
<br><br>
Until then,
<br>
Jose
