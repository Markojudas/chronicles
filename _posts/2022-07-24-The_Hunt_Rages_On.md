I have shifted down into overdrive my job hunt. Not only am I enrolled to start a technical prep course through <a href="https://codepath.com">CodePath.com</a> but I am following an Udemy <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews/">course</a> that not only helping be more comfortable with Python but also has given me great tips for job interviews and how to organize my job hunt.

Since I have been getting insta-rejected I decided to make some changes to my personal site and resume, hoping that could make a difference.

Besides these changes I have also subscribed for a <a href="https://lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html/">Lockeed Martin</a> hiring event, coming up the following week, and for a Tech Career Fair at FIU this coming September.

I need to keep this energy, if anything, I need to pump it up.
