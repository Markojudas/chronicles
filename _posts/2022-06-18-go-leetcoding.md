I believe I feel confident enough to start solving leetcode problems with Go. I have been slacking on leetcode worrying too much about learning technologies. I am creating a schedule for my learning lest I burn out. I should be finishing the Web Dev w/ Go course soon and then I'll start learning about containers (Docker and Kubernetes) and how to use them. I can't let the rejections I've gotten bring me down. It is all a matter of numbers and a test of my will.
