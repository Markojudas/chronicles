The journey has taken me now to start to learn Docker. While I understand this course (yes, Go Web Dev) is NOT a docker course but it does introduce it and I will see how to use it with Go and AWS soon. But first, another odyssey of getting technologies to work on Fedora... This is not part of the course as everything is done in Windows so I have to research outside the course to get things to work. Not only that, but the course is several years old and lots has change. Despite that, I'm only less than 5 hours away from completing this course (plus time spent researching and note taking).

Just like with MongoDB, albeit simpler, I am doing a small write-up on how I get things rolling with Docker.
